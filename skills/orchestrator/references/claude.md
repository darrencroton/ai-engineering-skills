# Claude Code CLI Reference

## Eligibility

Claude is eligible as Developer or delegate, in either access mode. The user, plan, or launcher chooses the role, model, and effort. This reference does not rank its capability.

## Read-only delegate launch

Write schema-v3 policy/request JSON as documented in [delegate-contract.md](delegate-contract.md), then use `delegate_jobs.py launch`. The launcher owns `claude -p`, model/effort flags, `--permission-mode plan`, output format, repository directory, prompt, and capture.

Read-only command shape:

```text
claude -p <prompt> [--model <model>] [--effort <effort>] --permission-mode plan --output-format text --add-dir <repo>
```

Plan mode is the closest tested read-only configuration. It restricts direct editing behavior, but command execution may still depend on harness/model behavior. Treat its read-only boundary as partial and rely on the delegate prompt, Developer verification, and repository mutation gates.

## Read-write delegate launch

Only valid against a policy whose `required_access` includes `read-write`. The launcher composes the same base command with `--permission-mode acceptEdits` instead of `plan`:

```text
claude -p <prompt> [--model <model>] [--effort <effort>] --permission-mode acceptEdits --output-format text --add-dir <repo>
```

`acceptEdits` auto-approves file edit tool calls headlessly; a smoke test in this repository confirmed it creates a file non-interactively without hanging. It does not mechanically confine writes to the request's `authorized_surface` — that boundary is prompt-enforced, exactly like the read-only prompt's no-mutation instruction. Other tool permissions (for example Bash commands not already allowed by the caller's own settings) may still require approval that a headless run cannot supply; treat an unattended stall as evidence the task needs different constraints, not as a reason to switch to a broader permission mode.

## Lifecycle

Use `delegate_jobs.py activity`, `wait`, `extract`, and `cancel`. The helper can discover Claude JSONL sessions and uses session timestamps plus assistant activity as health signals. Empty stdout while the process runs is not evidence of failure.

Do not continue a delegate through a raw `--resume` command. Write a new validated request with an `-rN` label.

## Authentication and configuration

Use the environment and authentication supplied by the caller. Do not redirect Claude home/configuration or invent credential variables. If an explicit model or effort is selected, the launcher passes it without capability ranking; report unsupported selections as launch failures.
