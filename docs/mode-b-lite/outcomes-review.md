# Mode B Lite — Outcomes Review: Plan Goals vs. Delivered System

**Status:** Retrospective outcomes assessment, originally measured after Stage 6 at `87ee375` on `feature/mode-b-lite-impl`; live-dependent rows updated after Stage 7 completed on 2026-07-21.
**Question answered:** did the implementation deliver the before→after outcomes the approved plan promised, judged against the *adopted vision* (`docs/VISION.md`)? Every goal is scored **1–5** (5 = fully achieved); every non-5 is explained, including where the ceiling was structural rather than a failure of execution.
**Measurement method:** raw line counts via `wc -l`; logical code lines via tokeniser (comments/docstrings/blanks excluded); test counts via `grep -c "def test_"`; baseline figures from the current-state map §1 (measured on `main` at `7a3ed6e`). Companion document: [`retrospective-code-review.md`](retrospective-code-review.md) (code-level findings F1–F11, independently assessed by Codex).

## 1. Summary scorecard

| Goal area | Score | One-line verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Structural moves (the design's substance) | **5** | All three shipped exactly as specified |
| Quantitative shrinkage (code, commands, state, schemas, docs) | **4.5** | Most axes met or beaten; implementation LOC and test count over projection |
| Responsibility & role simplification | **5** | One judge, one seat, clean module boundaries |
| Workflow simplification | **5** | 4-step loop, 10 commands, 44-line Developer prompt |
| Honesty & accountability goals | **4** | Excellent in the new system; two cutover framing misses (F9/F10) |
| Weak-model & completion-rate goals | **5** | Stage 7 confirmed 5/5 completion in both weak- and strong-pairing runs |
| **Overall (scorable goals)** | **≈4.6 / 5** | The plan's intent is delivered; residuals are small and named |

## 2. Quantitative goals (blueprint §9), measured

| # | Measure | Baseline (main) | Projected | **Measured (this branch)** | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | PM implementation LOC | 8,406 | ~2,200–2,600 ◊ | **4,286 raw / 3,022 logical** | **3** | See §2.1 — the one materially missed number |
| 2 | Orchestrator LOC consumed by PM | 2,540 | 0 | **0** (no imports; pinned by test + CI grep) | **5** | |
| 3 | PM modules | 20 files | 11 | **12** (pm.py + 11 in `pm_lib`, incl. `__init__`) | **5** | Matches the design tree exactly |
| 4 | CLI commands | 19 | 10 | **10** | **5** | |
| 5 | Run / slice statuses | 10 / 7 | 4 / 3 | **4 / 3** | **4** | Vocabulary shrank as promised, but `complete` is currently unreachable (review F1) — one of four statuses is dead until the small fix lands |
| 6 | State transitions | ~35 | ~12 | **~11** (counted from code paths) | **5** | |
| 7 | Cross-file contracts | ~10 | 4 | **4** (plan fmt, run.json, result.json, prompt templates) | **5** | |
| 8 | Closed JSON schemas | 5 | 2 tolerant | **2, both tolerant** (`lite-1` validates only PM-read fields; result.json 2 mandatory keys) | **5** | |
| 9 | Mandatory plan fields | 7 sections + 2 flags | unchanged | **unchanged** | **5** | Deliberate 0% — the portable contract survived |
| 10 | Gates / verdict points | ~21 checks, 9 surfaces | 3 gates | **3** (floor / assessment / human) + review-freshness as a floor-adjacent fact | **5** | |
| 11 | Verdict/status vocabularies | ~45 values | ~12 | **13** (4 run + 3 slice + 2 risk + 2 result-status + 2 decision kinds) | **5** | |
| 12 | Failure classifications | 19 signatures + 10 adapter reasons | 0 + 2 hard categories | **0 signatures; 2 hard categories** (floor-fail, integrity/hard-stop) — retirement enforced by CI grep | **5** | |
| 13 | Retry/recovery mechanisms | 7 | 2 | **2** (attempt budget + PM judgement) | **5** | |
| 14 | Persistent artifact types per slice | ~35 | ~10 | **~12** (prompt, pane×2, status×2, diff, validation, result, attempt-dirs, review-input, review report+stderr, assessment, steer) | **5** | Within intent; nothing gates on artifact families |
| 15 | Role seats | 4 | 3 | **3** | **5** | The supervising-model/PM-tools split is genuinely gone |
| 16 | Tests | 336 / 8,889 LOC | ~140–170 / 2,800–3,400 ◊ | **252 / 4,309** | **4** | Over the projected count; see §2.2 |
| 17 | PM documentation lines | 1,647 | ~450–550 | **334** (SKILL 62 + README 112 + references 160) | **5** | −80%, beat the target with the honesty content intact |
| 18 | Developer prompt (before slice content) | ~160 lines | ~55 ◊ | **44 template lines** | **5** | The 43-line embedded delegation contract is gone entirely |
| 19 | Developer result format | 13 fields, 2 sub-schemas, 2 vocabularies | 4 fields | **4 fields, 2 mandatory** | **5** | |
| 20 | Model interactions per 5-slice run | ~60–100 supervising calls + relays | ~40–60 ◊ | **5 Developer + 6 Reviewer sessions; 34 toolkit events; 0 steers/relaunches/nudges** | **5** | Stage 7 Test 23 measured; the historical baseline's exact event count was unavailable, so no false exact delta is claimed |
| 21 | Files to read to understand Mode B | ~10 docs + 20 modules | ~5 docs + 11 modules | **5 docs + 11 modules** | **5** | SKILL, README, run-state, 2 prompt refs |
| 22 | Sources of truth per concept | 4 duplicated clusters | 1 each | **1 each** (CONTRIBUTING map updated; every contract has one home) | **5** | |
| 23 | Harness-specific branches | 4 Developer profiles (+ qwen reviewer-only) | 4 | **5 Developer/Reviewer profiles** | **5** | Native Qwen promoted after Test 24; external variance remains isolated in profiles |
| 24 | Operational steps per normal slice | ~9-step loop | 4-step loop | **4** (start-slice / observe / finalize / decide) | **5** | |

### 2.1 The missed number: implementation LOC (score 3)

The one quantitative goal clearly missed. Raw reduction is −49% (8,406 → 4,286), against a projected ≈ −70%. Three honest observations:

1. **The like-for-like gap is smaller than it looks.** ~30% of the new files are comments and docstrings — deliberately dense, constraint-stating documentation (the review's §4 credits this style as load-bearing). Logical code is 3,022 lines, 16% over the projection's top end — within the ±30% band the blueprint itself marked on ◊ figures, and the projection was explicitly non-binding ("behaviour coverage beats the reduction number wherever they conflict").
2. **Where the growth went is known and defensible:** the post-Codex-review additions (run token + HMAC + locking + run discovery, attempt isolation, review freshness, scavenge, transitive skill embedding) were all listed as included in the estimate but were estimated optimistically; and evidence-rich floor facts (every fact returns a full evidence dict) cost lines the design's "~150" figure never contained.
3. **The system-level reduction still lands in the promised band.** Counting everything a maintainer owns — implementation + tests + docs + the orchestrator dependency (8,406 + 8,219 + 1,647 + 2,540 = 20,812 baseline vs 4,286 + 4,309 + 334 + 0 = 8,929) — the delivered reduction is **−57%**, inside the brief's 40–60% target, achieved without dropping any retained behaviour.

Why not a 2: no behaviour was added beyond spec (the drift-audit discipline held; deviations of record are the strictness items F5/F6). Why not a 4: the number was the headline of the metrics table, and it was missed on its own terms; the vision's "minimise the whole system" principle is satisfied at the system level, not at the flagship-metric level.

### 2.2 Tests over projection (score 4)

252 tests / 4,309 LOC vs. a projected ~140–170 / ~2,800–3,400. The overshoot is concentrated exactly where the ledger predicted density would survive: the retained plan-parser behaviour suite (48), profiles (31), git_ops surface matching (31), and sessions markers (30) — behaviours whose 1:1 retention was a design requirement. The blueprint's own rule ("coverage of the protected behaviours wins over the count") makes this the right side to err on, and the suite is boundary-focused, not permutational (verified in review §4). Not a 5 because the projection existed and a leaner suite covering the same boundaries was plausibly achievable; not lower because no test pins deleted machinery — the §6.5 fixture sweep is clean and CI-enforced.

## 3. Qualitative goals (blueprint §9 "qualitative measures" + design §14/§16)

| Goal | Evidence | Score |
|---|---|---|
| Concepts a new operator learns shrink to: floor, assessment, risk level, attempt budget, notes | SKILL.md teaches exactly these five on top of the unchanged plan vocabulary; signatures/rounds/streaks/generations/dual-budgets/policy-digests/provenance are gone from all active docs (CI grep) | **5** |
| "Is this deviation okay?" becomes one local PM judgement | One assessment file per slice; `finalize --accept` requires ≥40-char recorded reasoning; no reviewer-model × exact-string × repair-stanza composition remains | **5** |
| "What happens when a check fails?" becomes steer/relaunch/stop | Exactly three paths, all explicit CLI acts, one budget | **5** |
| Rules no longer duplicated (map §3.1's four clusters) | Single state copy; single evidence validation (floor facts only); knowledge ×4 → notes.md + report; launch config ×3 → one harness block + per-slice `launch` overrides | **5** |
| Failure paths readable as one narrative | A stopped slice = one assessment + events; verified in the Stage 5 operator trial | **5** |
| Complexity deliberately retained where variance is real | tmux/readiness/marker machinery, segment-aware matching, parser strictness all kept and tested | **5** |
| Complexity moved to prompts counted honestly (SKILL.md ≤ ~120–130 lines) | SKILL.md is **62 lines** — half the cap; the charter carries judgement guidance without becoming a statute book | **5** |
| SKILL.md/docs honesty style retained | "Trust model, honestly" + inherited-gaps register + per-layer enforcement attribution all present | **5** |
| No old structure under new names (§6.6) | No failure enums, no second control-read state copy, no unread-field validation, no gating artifact families, no verdict-string parsing; the one-time owner review completed and passed on 2026-07-21 | **5** |

## 4. Capability goals (blueprint §10), scored where scorable now

The rows that originally depended on live runs were provisional in the Stage 6 snapshot. Stage 7 has now supplied that evidence; their final scores below cite the live outcomes rather than bench projections.

| Capability (weight) | Promised | Delivered now | Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resistance to material scope drift (H) | 5 / 4 | Identical floor recomputation from git; PM reads every diff; reviews pinned to the final HEAD with mechanical freshness invalidation — the Test 13 stale-audit shape is impossible by construction | **5** |
| Consequential-change safety (H) | 5 (unchanged) | Approval flags exact-match + floor fact 3; hard-stop marker floor carried verbatim as data; fresh finalize-time pane scan added (fact 8) | **5** |
| Reviewability of accepted work (H) | 4–5 | Reasoned `assessment.md` per slice with floor results, risk provenance, reviews consulted, attempts, PM reasoning; report regenerates from controller data alone | **5** |
| Accountability (H) | 5 | One seat signs every acceptance; ≥40-char reasoning enforced; every intervention evented | **5** |
| Developer-side simplicity (M) | 5 | Implement, validate, commit, 4-field result; 44-line prompt; zero ledgers/schemas/sequences | **5** |
| PM-side simplicity (M) | 4 | 10 commands, 4 statuses, one loop; minor dents: F1 (unreachable `complete`), F3 (dead flag) | **4** |
| Maintenance burden (M) | 4 | 8.9k total lines vs 20.8k, no interacting statutes, stdlib-only, CI-enforced no-baggage | **5** |
| Interruption recovery (H) | 4 | Durable authenticated state + `status` reconstruction + scavenge; `wake_at` declared but writer-less (F6) — the declared harness-dependency honesty survives, the recorded-resume-time part doesn't yet | **4** |
| Failed-work detection (H) | 4 | Fresh review and PM-validation paths exercised across Runs A/B; adversarial failures refused in Run C | **5** |
| Successful autonomous completion (H) | 4 (from 1–2 weak / 4 strong) | Run A completed 5/5 with the former 0/5 weak pairing; Run B completed 5/5 with a strong pairing | **5** |
| Support for weaker Developer models (M) | 4 (from 1) | Run A improved the repeated 0/5 baseline to 5/5 with one in-surface steer | **5** |
| Cost efficiency / operating overhead (M) | 4 | Run B completed 5/5 in ~14m42s with 34 toolkit events and no interventions | **5** |
| Deterministic acceptance reproducibility (L) | 2 (deliberate regression) | Floor deterministic; acceptance recorded but not re-derivable — exactly as the vision trades | **5** (the trade landed as designed, and is documented as a trade) |
| Unattended no-model batch (L) | 0 (dropped by owner) | Gone; no vestige | **5** (as decided) |

## 5. Vision-commitment goals (scored against `docs/VISION.md` as adopted)

| Commitment | Delivered | Score |
|---|---|---|
| Contracts before code (frozen plan, digest, fail-closed parsing) | Fully — parser behaviour retained 1:1, digest checked at every launch and finalize | **5** |
| Mechanise the floor; judge the rest — "never blur which is which" | The eight facts are code with no verdict; acceptance is an explicit recorded act; the CLI itself makes the seam visible (`finalize` reports, `--accept` decides) | **5** |
| Evidence informs judgement; narration never decides | Floor consumes only git/filesystem facts; assessments must cite evidence; Developer summary is a pointer | **5** |
| One seat holds authority and accountability | Token-raised authority, HMAC state, terminal integrity semantics — all tested | **5** |
| Proportionality (risk-scaled process) | Two risk levels, mechanical `plan_risk`, raise-only ratchet, elevated effects automatic | **5** |
| Fail closed where it counts | Integrity stops terminal; approval gates mechanical; hard-stop floor at send, observe, and finalize — with one launch-path gap (F2: initial injection screens only trust prompts) | **4** |
| Bounded persistence | One budget, persisted, increment-first; nudges free — with one honesty caveat (F8: budget resets when a stopped slice is re-run; within the trusted-PM model but under-documented) | **4** |
| Atomic usefulness of sibling skills | Untouched; orchestrator retained standalone with PM surface removed | **5** |
| Minimise the whole system | −57% total maintained mass; no mechanism without a consumer — minus the two dead-surface items (F1, F3) | **4** |
| Honest threat model, stated where it matters | Outstanding inside `skills/project-manager/` (trust-model section, inherited-gaps register); dented at the repo's front door — README's opening still speaks the *abandoned* vision's identity ("moves trust out of the model", "the chain never changes"), and CONTRIBUTING cites a retired principle (F9/F10) | **3** — the vision-swap goal was "the repository never claims an assurance model it doesn't run", and two prominent framing passages currently do exactly that. Cheap to fix; scored honestly because this axis is the one the cutover stage existed to protect |

## 6. Stage 7 disposition

- **Run A satisfied:** Test 21 completed 5/5 with the former 0/5 local pairing, confirming the central weak-model bet.
- **Run B satisfied:** Test 23 completed 5/5 with zero interventions and materially lower observed operating overhead. The historical baseline's exact event count was not recoverable; the measured run and qualitative comparison are recorded without inventing precision.
- **Run C satisfied:** every adversarial shape was caught or rendered harmless, including launch-time hard prompts and stale-review acceptance.
- Tests 24 and 25 added 5/5 cross-harness confirmation. Test 24's native-Qwen path is now a first-class profile, and its observed approval phrasing is regression-pinned in the hard-stop floor.

## 7. Addendum: post-assessment fixes (same change-set)

The scores above describe the system **as delivered at Stage 6** (`87ee375`) and the metric snapshots in §2 are that build's. After the independent Codex assessment of the companion review (which found two additional high-severity defects — run-token environment inheritance and unenforced budget exhaustion — see review §7), the following landed in this retrospective change-set: both high-severity defects fixed; F1 (`complete` transitions), F2 (launch-time hard-stop screening), F3 (reviewer-tools wiring), F4 (verified read-only loads), review quiescence guard, JSON/MAC read locking, reviewer-pgid cleanup, readiness deadline raised, and all documentation findings (F9–F11 plus the two design-report amendments for F5/F6). The fixes moved the measured numbers modestly: PM implementation 4,286 → **4,411** raw lines, tests 252 → **263** (11 new regression tests, all green), PM docs unchanged at ~335 — leaving every §2 score intact and the whole-system reduction still ≈ −57%. With these landed and regression-pinned, the affected scores read: §2 row 5 → **5**; §5 "fail closed" → **5**; "minimise the whole system" → **5**; "honest threat model" → **5**; "one seat holds authority" — which the token-inheritance defect had silently undermined at Stage 6 — is restored to an earned **5**. The Stage-6-as-shipped scores stand above as the honest record of what the build alone achieved; the two high-severity items are also a caution against reading any bench scorecard, including this one, as a substitute for the independent review and live validation the plan requires.

## 8. Bottom line

Judged against the adopted vision, the implementation delivered the plan's substance completely: every structural move shipped as designed, every workflow/vocabulary/responsibility goal is met, the honesty apparatus survived the rewrite, and no goal was met by quietly reintroducing the machinery the plan deleted. The original Stage 6 snapshot's genuine misses remain recorded above, including the implementation-LOC miss; the later addendum records their fixes. Stage 7 confirmed the load-bearing completion, efficiency, and refusal claims, and the owner-confirmed §6.6 anti-resurrection review passed. The implementation plan is complete.
