"""Template rendering: the Developer and Reviewer prompts (target-design
§13.4).

The only prompt-shaping logic in the package lives here. Every other module
that needs rendered prompt text calls into this one — no inline prompt
fragments in `slice_ops.py`, `review.py`, or anywhere else
(implementation-blueprint.md §4). Templates are not owned by this module:
they live in ``references/developer-prompt.md`` and
``references/reviewer-prompt.md`` as single fenced ```md blocks, so wording
can be edited without touching code.

`compile_skill_bundle` re-specifies (never imports) the transitive
skill-bundle embedding behaviour documented as the one sanctioned
carry-over in ``docs/mode-b-lite/replacement-ledger.md`` §9.4, whose
behavioural evidence is ``skills/orchestrator/scripts/reviewer_contract.py``
(`compile_skill_bundle` / `compose_reviewer_command`) — this module shares
no code with it and never imports from ``skills/orchestrator/``.
