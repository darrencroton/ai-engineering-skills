"""Command orchestration for the slice lifecycle (target-design §3/§12).

This module wires the pieces other `pm_lib` modules already provide —
`state`, `plan`, `git_ops`, `sessions`, `profiles`, `prompts` — into the
per-command sequences described in target-design. Most of it still decides
nothing semantic: `init`/`status`/`approve`/`start-slice`/`observe`/`send`
and bare `finalize` only mutate state through the token-authenticated
`state` module, drive tmux through `sessions`, or read git/filesystem facts
through `git_ops` — `floor.py` computes the facts, never a verdict.

The one place semantic judgement enters this module is `finalize_accept` /
`finalize_steer` / `finalize_stop`: each is an explicit, recorded act the PM
agent takes through the CLI (never inferred from evidence alone), gated by
the floor (never waivable) and, on elevated slices, by review freshness
(design §5). Assessment text assembles facts around the PM's own reasoning
text; it never invents that reasoning.
