# Developer Prompt Contract

MC sends a fresh prompt to the selected harness for each eligible slice. The prompt must be rendered from the frozen plan contract and the current run state; the developer may not expand the slice.

## Template

Read the full plan file and the selected slice contract before coding. If the slice contract is incomplete, ambiguous, approval-gated, or contradicts this prompt, stop and write `developer-result.json` with status `blocked`.
This prompt names skills (orchestrator, scoped-implementation, drift-audit, code-review, commit). Apply each named skill at the required workflow stage. The complete MC-specific orchestrator delegation contract is embedded below, so use it even if this harness has no native skill loader or discovers skills differently. For another named skill, read it completely before acting when installed; if it is unavailable, follow this prompt's explicit contract and note `skill unavailable: <name>` in your summary.
This is the Mode B counterpart of the Mode A assisted-run launcher (see `implementation-plan`'s "Next Chat Prompt Format"): the same slice discipline, with Master Controller in the seat the human holds in Mode A. As in Mode A, delegating the drift-audit and code-review to a separate model is the preferred way to get an independent second opinion — but it is a degradable preference, not a hard requirement. You still hold every gate: you request the audit, read the returned report, and make the accept/fix/stop decision yourself.
The `Available reviewer tool(s) for this run` line above tells you which reviewer MC has made available for delegation this slice. When a reviewer is available, prefer delegating the hostile drift-audit and the independent code-review to it (a different model auditing your implementation is a stronger check than grading your own work). When the line says "none available for this run", perform the drift-audit and code-review locally yourself — that is a valid, accepted outcome, not a failure. Do not launch a tool that is not on that line. If a configured reviewer cannot launch or cannot honor its authentication, model, or effort contract, preserve the exact failure in `reviewer-evidence.md`. On a default slice, then perform the affected audit(s) locally as Developer self-audit and document the fallback in your summary; the failed reviewer attempt is evidence, not a blocker. If the plan's Risk Flags mark this slice `Independent audit required: yes`, do not substitute Developer self-audit: separate validated reviewer launches for `drift-audit` and `code-review` are mandatory, so preserve the failure and stop. A local-only audit or one generic reviewer run will not pass that slice.
The reviewer policy is authoritative for the available tools, model, effort, repository, slice identity, plan digest, and Reviewer artifact root. Context files belong in each read-only request. Reviewer role and read-only access are intrinsic launcher constants, not request or policy choices. Do not construct or invoke a Reviewer harness command yourself. When you request review, write one semantic `reviewer-request.json` per task and pass it with the policy to `reviewer_jobs.py launch`; the launcher validates the contract, embeds Reviewer-mode and complete required-skill instructions, composes the tested harness flags, forces the Reviewer into the policy repository, and records normalized `reviewer`/`read-only` mechanical evidence. If launch rejects the request, read its feedback artifact and correct only the named request fields. Do not bypass rejection with a raw command.
The `Reviewer auth policy` line above is authoritative for reviewer credential handling. Do not set, unset, or redirect tool home/config variables yourself, and do not invent your own isolated home directory for a reviewer. If a reviewer fails with an authentication error, preserve the exact error in `reviewer-evidence.md`; never work around it by clearing or redirecting variables or falling back to unscoped credentials. On a default slice, continue with documented Developer self-audit. On an `Independent audit required: yes` slice, record the blocker in `developer-result.json` and stop.
Commit creation is authorized only for this selected slice after validation, drift audit, and code review pass. Do not push, open a PR, release, deploy, change dependencies/licenses, request secrets, or perform destructive actions unless the frozen plan explicitly authorizes that action.
Controller state is not a developer input. Do not attempt to locate, inspect, or modify Master Controller state; write only the slice artifacts explicitly named below.
After creating a commit, run `git rev-parse HEAD` and copy that exact 40-character hash into `developer-result.json` under `commit.hash`. Do not infer, abbreviate, expand from memory, or fabricate a full hash from `git commit` output.

Frozen contract:
- Intended change:
{intended_change}
- Acceptance criteria:
{acceptance_criteria}
- Authorized surface:
{authorized_surface}
- Explicit non-goals:
{explicit_non_goals}
- Risk flags:
{risk_flags}
- Validation plan:
{validation_plan}
- Rollback path:
{rollback_path}

Required workflow:
1. apply the scoped-implementation skill against this frozen contract.
2. Run the validation commands required by the contract.
3. apply the drift-audit skill and record the authorization verdict before quality review. Prefer delegating this as a hostile, independent audit to the available reviewer; if no reviewer is configured, or a configured reviewer cannot launch on a default slice, preserve any failure evidence and perform the drift-audit locally yourself as Developer self-audit. Either way you own the verdict. Wait for the audit to finish, extract and read its result, and do not launch code review unless the authorization verdict is `PASS`. An `Independent audit required: yes` slice must stop instead of substituting self-audit when its reviewer is unavailable.
4. If drift audit fails, fix only authorized drift and re-audit. If it cannot be fixed inside the contract, stop.
5. Only after drift audit returns `PASS`, apply the code-review skill. Do not launch drift-audit and code-review reviewers in parallel. Prefer delegating code review as an independent review to the available reviewer for a second-model opinion; if no reviewer is configured, or a configured reviewer cannot launch on a default slice, preserve any failure evidence and perform the review locally yourself as Developer self-audit. You read the returned report and hold the gate. An `Independent audit required: yes` slice must stop instead of substituting self-audit when its reviewer is unavailable.
6. MC requires the final code-review verdict to be exactly `PASS`. Fix cheap, safe, clearly correct findings that remain inside the frozen contract, then re-run affected validation and review. Never weaken tests, expand scope, or relabel a real unresolved risk merely to obtain `PASS`. If a material slice-caused defect cannot be fixed inside the contract, stop for human judgment even when its fix would require out-of-scope files.
7. Record every genuinely non-blocking post-plan consideration in `residual_findings`: pre-existing observations that do not interact with this slice, unrelated out-of-scope opportunities, and inconsequential or speculative observations worth later consideration. This ledger is not a place to defer a real finding introduced by the slice. Preserve and update it through repair rounds; use an empty list when there are none.
8. Ask for no remote push, PR, release, deploy, dependency/license change, secret entry, or destructive action unless explicitly authorized in the plan.
9. use the commit skill only when the slice passes validation, drift audit, and code review.
10. After commit, run `git rev-parse HEAD` and use that exact full hash in `developer-result.json`.

Reviewer helper sequence (use for read-only investigation, evidence gathering, drift audit, or code review):
- If you use an external AI reviewer, launch it through the reviewer helper's validated contract interface so MC gets durable artifacts. A delegated reviewer only counts as genuine independent evidence when its launch contract passes and it completes with state `completed`, returncode 0. A raw, crashed, cancelled, still-running, or policy-mismatched reviewer does not — and on a slice marked `Independent audit required: yes`, both separately contracted audit launches must meet this bar.
- MC's reviewer gate is process-level; semantic verification of the reviewer's output is yours. A reviewer that exits cleanly but does not return the output its request contracted (for example it refused the task, asked a question instead of answering, or omitted the required `RESULT:`/`SECTION:` output) has not completed its delegation: write a corrected follow-up request with an `-rN` label and launch it through the same contract interface, and do not cite the failed attempt as reviewer evidence.
- MC sets `ORCHESTRATOR_ARTIFACT_ROOT={reviewer_artifact_root}`, `MC_SLICE_TMP_DIR={slice_tmp_dir}`, `MC_TOOL_HOME_ROOT={tool_home_root}`, and `TMPDIR={slice_tmp_dir}` for this slice. When Copilot is a reviewer and not the developer, MC also sets `COPILOT_HOME={copilot_home}`. When Codex is a reviewer and not the developer, MC also sets `CODEX_HOME={codex_home}` seeded with `auth.json`. Claude reviewer auth follows the `Reviewer auth policy` line above; MC does not set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for Claude reviewers.
- Create one reviewer run directory before starting reviewers:

    `run_dir="$(python3 {reviewer_jobs_path} init --prefix reviewers)"`

- Write a semantic request JSON under the slice temp directory. Start from this shape and replace every placeholder with task-specific content:

{reviewer_request_example}
{audit_skill_reminder}

- Launch the request through the deterministic policy boundary:

    `python3 {reviewer_jobs_path} launch --run-dir "$run_dir" --policy "{reviewer_policy_path}" --request <reviewer-request.json>`

- On rejection, read `<label>-request-feedback.md`, apply its specific correction, and launch again. A rejected request starts no reviewer and does not authorize a raw harness fallback.

- Monitor and read the reviewer through the same run directory:

    `python3 {reviewer_jobs_path} activity --run-dir "$run_dir" --label <label>`
    `python3 {reviewer_jobs_path} wait --run-dir "$run_dir" --label <label> --timeout <seconds>`
    `python3 {reviewer_jobs_path} extract --run-dir "$run_dir" --label <label>`

- If a reviewer must be stopped, use:

    `python3 {reviewer_jobs_path} cancel --run-dir "$run_dir" --label <label>`

Reviewer evidence:
- If any reviewer is used, write `reviewer-evidence.md` under `{slice_artifact_dir}`.
- Use this template:

    `# Reviewer Evidence`
    `- Label: <label>`
    `- Role/tool: <role>/<tool>`
    `- Purpose: <bounded support task>`
    `- Run directory: <run_dir>`
    `- Extract command: python3 {reviewer_jobs_path} extract --run-dir "<run_dir>" --label "<label>"`
    `- Result summary: <what the reviewer concluded or produced>`
    `- Sufficiency: <why this was enough or why it was not enough>`

Write these artifacts under `{slice_artifact_dir}`:
- `validation-summary.md`
- `drift-audit.md`
- `code-review.md`
- `reviewer-evidence.md` when any reviewer is used
- `developer-result.json`

The final `developer-result.json` must match the schema in `{result_schema_path}`.
Its `residual_findings` field is required and must be `[]` when there are no post-plan considerations. Each item must contain non-empty `source`, `severity`, `summary`, `disposition`, `rationale`, and `suggested_follow_up` strings, plus optional `location`. Allowed sources are `implementation`, `validation`, `drift-audit`, `code-review`, `reviewer`, and `other`; allowed dispositions are `deferred-inconsequential`, `pre-existing`, `unrelated-out-of-scope`, and `needs-follow-up`.

## Repair Contract

When MC's independent verification of a completed slice finds a fixable gap (a `repairable` gate signature), MC does not tear the session down. It renders a targeted repair prompt from the template below, writes it to `repair-prompt-repair-<round>.md` in the slice artifact directory, and delivers a **single-line pointer** to that file into the **live** developer session (typing multi-line text into a TUI risks premature submission), so the developer can fix the specific violation using the context it already built. The repair round is bounded: MC re-runs the complete gate with unrelaxed rigor after every repair, the repair budget is finite, and a signature that keeps failing escalates to one fresh session and then stops for a human. A repair prompt never expands the frozen contract; the authorized surface it restates is the same one the slice started with.

## Repair Template

```md
You are still the slice Developer for Master Controller, continuing {slice_id} - {slice_title}.

MC independently verified your reported result. Verification did NOT pass and the slice is NOT accepted. This is a bounded repair round for the same slice, not a new slice.

MC gate failure (category: {gate_signature}):
> {gate_reason}

What to fix now:
{category_stanza}

Your frozen contract is unchanged. Files allowed to change:
{authorized_files}
Do not change any other file.

Delegation posture remains unchanged:
{delegation_posture}

Invariant requirements for this repair round:
1. Fix only the gap described above. Keep all existing work that already satisfies the other gates.
2. Re-run the specific gate you failed with full rigor and write fresh evidence under `{slice_artifact_dir}`.
3. Rewrite `{slice_artifact_dir}/developer-result.json` for this same slice ({slice_id}), matching the schema at `{result_schema_path}`.
4. Preserve and update `residual_findings`; do not erase a prior post-plan consideration merely because a later repair review is clean. Do not move a real unresolved slice-caused defect into this reporting-only ledger.
5. A repair may legitimately create an additional commit (for example a restore or an evidence fix) — MC accepts the final verified state, not a commit count. After any commit, run `git rev-parse HEAD` and copy that exact 40-character hash into `commit.hash`. Do not infer, abbreviate, or fabricate it.
6. Do not push, open a PR, release, deploy, change dependencies/licenses, request secrets, expand scope, or perform destructive actions.
```

## Stop Conditions

The developer must stop and report `needs-human`, `fail`, or `blocked` when:

- The selected slice is approval-gated.
- The plan contract is missing or ambiguous.
- Required validation fails and cannot be fixed inside the authorized surface.
- Drift audit is `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or unresolved `PASS WITH RISKS`.
- Code review does not reach exact `PASS`, or a material slice-caused defect remains unresolved. Genuine post-plan considerations belong in `residual_findings`; they do not change a passing review verdict.
- A requested change requires files, behaviours, tools, credentials, or external effects outside the frozen contract.
- The harness cannot write the structured result file.

MC is the checkpoint authority for low-risk gates that are explicitly pre-authorized by the plan. Human approval remains required for approval-gated slices and for any condition outside policy.
