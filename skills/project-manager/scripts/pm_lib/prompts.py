"""Developer and repair prompt rendering: the templates a slice harness actually receives.

Composes the frozen slice contract, prior-slice context, and reviewer/policy
paths into the prompt text sent to a fresh Developer session, and the
targeted in-session repair prompts for a bounded, unrelaxed gate retry. Never
re-derives or relaxes a gate; only renders what the gate decision and frozen
